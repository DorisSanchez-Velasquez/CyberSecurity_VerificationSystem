# CyberSecurity_VerificationSystem
Given UID.txt and Hash.txt files, implement a verification system such that a given password and salt can match with the hash value with the database, Hash.txt. Additionally, given a user id from UID.txt, implement a brute force cracker system to find the password and salt associated with said user.
